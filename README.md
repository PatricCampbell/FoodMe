# FoodMe

This is a demo project to showcase the [pMoney](https://github.com/PatricCampbell/pMoney) DOM manipulation library. You can view it [here](https://patriccampbell.github.io/FoodMe/).

FoodMe uses pMoney for DOM manipulation, traversal, and the AJAX calls to the Edamam recipe API. It allows you to select an ingredient and receive 10 random recipes with that ingredient. You can choose from all recipes, vegan recipes, and vegetarian recipes.
